# VatsimTrafficNotify
Creates alerts for specific traffic that fly within, out and into the VATSSA airspace sectors.

It will also send alerts to a specific Telegram group for VATSSA. 

Currently it has a small UI, which you can see here: https://sky-net.co.za/vatsim-traffic-alert/index.html, but its actual functionality is posting to a Telegram group. Talk to me on VATSSA Discord if you want to get notifications.
